Block comparison widget made with ReactTS, Tailwind, and Framer Motion for Synthesis (◡‿◡✿) 

Live deploy here: https://disco-stack-compare.netlify.app/

A few small notes on where I deviated from the spec: 

- I decided not to made the label under the stack have an input mode, I felt it was cleaner to just have that in the control panel (plus you can already also click/drag in the block screen to add/remove)

- For drawing mode - click/touch+drag would definitely work better on mobile, but for now I just implemented click to start and click to end. Aside from that, I tried to give it basic mobile compatibility

Thanks for checking it out!!
